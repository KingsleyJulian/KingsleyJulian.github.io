            My Hobbies are reading light novels, instruction manuals and documentations that has anything to do with programming and hardware, as well as Codices/Codex of Laws on PDF formats.
            <br><br>
              I love reading law books in my free time, due to my curiousity on the abstract ways on how laws bound people.

              Some of the stories were even reviewed by my friends as good, but at most the stories that I wrote were for my own enjoyment.

             [This is a prologue of the story I was writing for a while now, As for the other chapters I am still working on it. This is a sci-fi genre that leans on militaristic setting.]
             <br><br>

             [Prologue]
             <br><br>
             As I sat down in a pool of blood...On a moment of clarity, I felt a stinging pain across my whole body.
             <br><br>
              The pool of blood is my own.
              <br><br>
              I tried to scream, but only moans of pain could be heard reverbrating in this dark room.
              <br><br>
              Even breathing is hard, I could only breathe shallowly as breathing any deeper stimulates the various cuts and torn muscles on my chest.
              <br><br>
              Glancing down to my chest.
              <br><br>
              There's a knife lodged near my heart, blood seeped out of the fatal wound inflicted on my body.
              <br><br>
              'I have too many questions.'
              <br><br>
              First.
              <br><br>
              'Where am I?'
              <br><br>
              Second.
              <br><br>
              'Why am I in this state?'
              <br><br>
              Third.
              <br><br>              
              'Who am I?'
              <br><br>
              As I breathe with an extremely blurry vision and nausea.
              <br><br>
              Banging noise echoed through the room.
              <br><br>
Voices of unknown origin could be heard across the room.
<br><br>
I tried to call for help once again.
<br><br>
The only thing I could muster from this battered body is make some noise with the interlocking chains that used to restrict my broken arms.
<br><br>
"Arggghk...help..fuck!"
<br><br>
Despite knowing the fact that it'll only further aggravate the wounds, he clanked the chains.
<br><br>
Soon, gunshots resounded on the other side.
<br><br>
Bang Bang
<br><br>
"Commander!" a female voice said anxiously.
<br><br>
By then, the man cuffed in chains has already lost consciousness.
<br><br>
The door opened.
<br><br>
Several armed people secured the place and lit their lights.
<br><br>
Their eyes reflected sheer horror at the scene they saw.
<br><br>
There lay a man who sat laid back on a wall, with his arms both chained up to the walls.
<br><br>
Countless scars could be seen on his body, arms and fingers facing the wrong direction, missing nails on both hands and feet, a knife stabbed into his chest, all of this while lying in his own pool of blood.
<br><br>
Looking at him from afar, it is already clear that there is no way such a person would survive a torture the went beyond the limits of what a normal human could endure, the knife itself declared that whoever did this, did not want the other person to survive.
<br><br>
The armed personel walked slowly with downcast eyes, some even had tears flowing down.
<br><br>
"Commander...guh." The woman that opened the door said in a low voice.
<br><br>
She removed her helmet, blue eyes and golden hair were displayed, if not for the fact the her expressions were extremely grim she would look extremely beautiful.
<br><br>
"Why...how..could they do this!?"
<br><br>
Someone tapped the shoulder of the blonde woman.
<br><br>
"Carmen.. stand back, let us handle this for now the search and rescue operations should be changed to destroy and conquer."
<br><br>
Another woman dressedcin black military gear spoke in extreme rage hidden within her calm tone.
<br><br>
The crew dressed in black ops gear immediately took bolt cutters from their gear and cut off the chains from the wall.
<br><br>
One of them tried to dislodge the knife stuck on the Commander's chest, but stopped when he saw a faint movement from the body.
<br><br>
"Mam! Checking for vitals!" the operative said so in an urgent voice.
<br><br>
The operative, shined lights and opened his eyelids.
<br><br>
"Pupillary Response! the Commander's still alive!"
<br><br>
A voice mixed with both excitenent and worry resounded.
<br><br>
Carmen immediately took on her radio.
<br><br>
"Send med-team alpha towards our location, have them be escorted by all six strike teams! I repeat send med-team alpha with all six strike teams inside! this is no longer a covert search and rescue ops! get in here within 3 minutes no matter the cost! the Commander is critically injured and needs immediate care."
<br><br>
A reply resounded from the radio.
<br><br>
"Affirmative! requesting permission to use Railguns to breach!"
<br><br>
"Permission granted! but avoid aiming directly to the building! AS FOR ANYTHING ELSE DESTROY IT!" Carmen replied.
<br><br>
<br><br>
[This is nothing more than a sample on the story I am trying to write, amateur as it may be I am trying hard to get into the perspective.]
